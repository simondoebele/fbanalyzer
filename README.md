# Facebook Messages Parser and Analyzer

## What is this repository about?

This repository features a parser and analyzer for facebook message data. More specifically, the analyzer currently has two functions: to get the total number of words exchanged with another person, and to display a sentiment score over time during a chat with another person.
The message parser is a modified version from [mjmeli](https://github.com/mjmeli/facebook-chat-word-cloud/blob/master/facebook_wordcloud/message_parser.py).
All other code is written by me.

## How is the repository structured?

This repository currently contains the Jupyter Notebook with further documentation.
Before using it, you will need to gather your facebook message data (via their website) and place it in a separate directory called "messages".
